# OBJECTIVE
Predicting flight ticket prices using machine learning and artificial neural networks.

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices by leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically employing artificial neural networks (ANN). The dataset used for training and testing the model includes various features such as airline, departure city, arrival city, departure time, arrival time, and more.

## Key Features

- **Airline**: The airline providing the flight service.
- **Departure City**: The city from which the flight departs.
- **Arrival City**: The city to which the flight arrives.
- **Departure Time**: The time of day when the flight departs.
- **Arrival Time**: The time of day when the flight arrives.
- **Duration**: The duration of the flight.
- **Total Stops**: The number of stops during the flight.
- **Remaining Days**: The number of days remaining until the journey date.
- **Journey Month, Date, Day**: Specifics about the journey date.
- **Route**: The route from departure city to arrival city.
- **Is Direct Flight**: Binary indication of whether the flight is direct or not.

## Models and Achievements

The project employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting flight ticket prices. Key highlights include:

- **Model**: Implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Achieved an accuracy of 95% by fine-tuning hyperparameters using Keras Tuner.
- **Saved Model**: The trained ANN model is saved for future use.

## Repository Structure

- **[Data/](Data/)**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **[Notebooks/](Notebooks/)**: Jupyter notebooks documenting the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **[Saved_Models/](Saved_Models/)**: Holds the saved ANN model.
